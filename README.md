# Sonic-Pi-DayTime-25
Here you'll find the Play 60 Sonic Pi source files for the DayTime 25 MusicEdNet conference.
Include are the coded audio files in *.rb file format and required additonal samples in *.wav format.

Not all Sonic pi files need additional samples but I have included the extra wavs required for the files that need them.

You will need to download the *.rb files and related addtional *.wav files.
Put the *.wav files in a directory on your system.

Drag-n-drop the wav file into the related Sonic Pi file to create a path to the required wav
For example: Download Running From The Fire and new5.wav.

Pop the new5.wav into your own directory/folder where you want to keep your own external audio samples (*.wav file format)

Open Running From The Fire

Now... drag a copy of the new5.wav to infront of where you see variable named dr1.

Now... run the code, edit it as much as you like. You can even create your own samples 

Follow these steps for all files where external sound samples are used :)

Happy coding.
